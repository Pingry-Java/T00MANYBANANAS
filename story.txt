Sringeri Drinivas was carrying his load of bananas when somone texted him. 
He picked up his phone, and proceeded to text the person back.
However, since he was texting, he did not pay attention to the road!
His donkey had veered off the road, and they had crashed!
Worst of all, his precious bananas were all ruined!
That day, Srigeri Drinivas learned a valuable lesson.
Don't text and drive.
